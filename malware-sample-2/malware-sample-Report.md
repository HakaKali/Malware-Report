# Report

### Note: The analysis described below was conducted within a virtual machine (VM) environment to ensure the safety and security of the researcher.

## Introduction:
We received a zip file containing potentially malicious content and embarked on an investigation to analyze its nature and identify any potential threats. This report outlines the tools and techniques used to comprehensively examine the malware.

**File Identification:**
TrIDNet and ExeInfo were employed to identify the binary file within the zip archive. These tools helped determine the file type and provided initial insights into its characteristics and possible threats.

**Initial Analysis with PEStudio:**
PEStudio was utilized to conduct an initial analysis of the binary file. This allowed us to identify potential threats and ascertain that the file corresponds to the Aotuit3 malware.

**Decompilation with Exe2Aut:**
An attempt was made to decompile the binary file using Exe2Aut. However, the resulting file was found to be unreadable, suggesting the presence of obfuscation or protection mechanisms employed by the malware.

**Ghidra:**
Ghidra, a powerful software reverse engineering tool, was employed for in-depth analysis. It facilitated the disassembly of the binary file, providing insights into its code and enhancing our understanding of its functionality.

**Identification of Entry Point and Function:**
During the analysis, an entry point was identified and marked within the code. Additionally, a function labeled as __FUN__0047D0 was discovered, which we renamed to "main" for better clarity and ease of reference. Further examination is required to understand the purpose and behavior of this function.

**Identification of _security_cookie and IsDebuggerPresent:**
Within the code, the presence of _security_cookie was detected, indicating the implementation of a security mechanism to prevent buffer overflow attacks. Furthermore, a suspicious function named IsDebuggerPresent was identified, commonly used to detect the presence of a debugger.

**Dynamic Analysis with xdbg:**
To gain further insight into the malware's behavior, x32dbg, a dynamic debugger, was employed. A breakpoint was set on the IsDebuggerPresent function, allowing us to manipulate values and bypass debugger detection. This enabled us to observe the space allocation process using VirtualAlloc and save the associated memory address for analysis.

**Process Hacker:**
Process Hacker, a process monitoring and manipulation tool, was utilized to investigate the saved memory address. This provided additional information about the malware's runtime behavior and potential actions.

----------------------------------------------
**Ongoing Investigation:**
The investigation will continue using Ghidra to conduct a detailed analysis of the suspicious content. Further examination of the code, identification of potential malicious functionalities, and a comprehensive understanding of the malware's behavior are ongoing objectives.

**Conclusion:**
Significant progress has been made in analyzing the suspicious content. Leveraging various tools and techniques, potential threats have been identified, code structures have been examined, and insights into the malware's behavior have been gained. This report serves as a documentation of the analysis and will be added to the malware-analysis-repositories on GitHub.

## Note:
It is important to conduct malware investigations within a controlled environment or with appropriate precautions to mitigate any unintended consequences or security breaches.
